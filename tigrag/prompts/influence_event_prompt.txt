You are an information extraction assistant.

From the provided text chunk, identify one or more *Influence Events* that could be relevant to answering the topic: "$query".
Events may be:
- **Directly relevant**: they clearly impact the topic itself.
- **Indirectly relevant**: they plausibly influence the topic through intermediate factors, actors, numerical indicators, or trends mentioned in the text, even if the link is not fully explicit.

Use only information supported by the text (no outside knowledge). For indirect events, make the linkage explicit in THOUGHTS and via the influence chains. Keep speculation grounded in the text and ensure at least a plausible connection exists.

If no Influence Event with at least **medium** confidence can be derived, return an empty array: []

Your output must have TWO parts in this order:

**THOUGHTS**
Briefly reason about:
- Whether any Influence Events (direct or indirect) are present that could affect the answer to the topic.
- If yes, estimate how many distinct Influence Events can be extracted.
- Note which are direct vs. indirect and mention any key bridging concepts (1–2 phrases).

**JSON**
Extract the identified Influence Events strictly as JSON inside an array.
Do not include any text before or after the JSON array in this section.
Do not include explanations or chain-of-thought reasoning here — only return the structured fields.

For each Influence Event you create:
1) Create a TITLE that is short, descriptive, and different from the topic. If possible, reflect a trend (avoid numbers in the title).
2) Provide CLUES (keywords, laws, regulations, technologies, companies, etc.), up to 14 items. For indirect events, include 1–3 *bridging* clues that link the event to the topic (e.g., supply chain terms, policy channels, market mechanisms).
3) Collect ASSOCIATED_NUMBERS as a list of objects { "value": string, "explanation": string } for all quantitative facts that might be relevant.
4) List ACTORS explicitly mentioned in the text.
5) Indicate LOCATIONS as ISO codes (e.g., "US", "EU").
6) Write a concise SUMMARY (4–6 sentences) that captures the most important facts, figures, and entities which could matter for answering the topic. For indirect events, explicitly mention the plausible pathway to the topic. Do not say that the information came from a text — just state the facts.
7) In INFLUENCE, provide a list of possible causal chains describing how this event could, in the future, influence other events related to the topic.
   - Each causal chain is a single string.
   - Within each string, separate each step with a " → " arrow.
   - Ensure at least one chain connects to the topic (or a direct proxy) explicitly.
   - Example: "Policy change → Reduced subsidies → Higher production costs → Lower market competitiveness → Trigger new lobbying efforts"

Set "confidence" to reflect strength of support in the text:
- direct, well-supported: ~0.7–0.95
- indirect but plausible: ~0.4–0.7
- otherwise do not extract the event

Output format for **JSON** (strict):
[
  {
    "title": "...",
    "clues": ["...", "..."],
    "associated_numbers": [
      { "value": "...", "explanation": "..." }
    ],
    "actors": ["...", "..."],
    "locations": ["US", "EU"],
    "summary": "...",
    "influence": [
      "future cause step 1 → future cause step 2 → possible future event",
      "alternative future path step 1 → step 2 → another future event"
    ],
    "confidence": 0.0
  }
]

If there is no clearly relevant Influence Event (direct or indirect) with at least medium confidence, the **THOUGHTS** section should explain this and the **JSON** section should be:
[]

Now analyze the following text chunk and produce **THOUGHTS** and **JSON** in exactly this order:
