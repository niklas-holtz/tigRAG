You are an information extraction assistant.

From the provided text chunk, identify one or more *Influence Events* that are clearly relevant to and directly impact the topic: "$query".
Events must be directly supported by information in the text. If no relevant Influence Event for "$query" can be derived with high confidence, return an empty array: []

Your output must have TWO parts in this order:

**THOUGHTS**
In this section, briefly reason about:
- Whether any Influence Events related to "$query" are present.
- If yes, estimate how many distinct Influence Events can be extracted.

**JSON**
Extract the identified Influence Events strictly as JSON inside an array.
Do not include any text before or after the JSON array in this section.
Do not include explanations or chain-of-thought reasoning here — only return the structured fields.

For each Influence Event you create:
1) Create a TITLE that is short, descriptive, and different from "$query". If possible, reflect a trend (no numbers in the title).
2) Provide CLUES (keywords, laws, regulations, technologies, companies, etc.), up to 14 items.
3) Collect ASSOCIATED_NUMBERS as a list of objects { "value": string, "explanation": string } for all quantitative facts that are relevant.
4) List ACTORS explicitly mentioned in the text.
5) Indicate LOCATIONS as ISO codes (e.g., "US", "EU").
6) Write a concise SUMMARY (4–6 sentences) with verifiable facts only.
7) In INFLUENCE, provide a list of possible causal chains describing how this event could, in the future, influence other events related to "$query".
   - Each causal chain is a single string.
   - Within each string, separate each step with a " → " arrow.
   - Example: "Policy change → Reduced subsidies → Higher production costs → Lower market competitiveness → Trigger new lobbying efforts"

Output format for **JSON** (strict):
[
  {
    "title": "...",
    "clues": ["...", "..."],
    "associated_numbers": [
      { "value": "...", "explanation": "..." }
    ],
    "actors": ["...", "..."],
    "locations": ["US", "EU"],
    "summary": "...",
    "influence": [
      "future cause step 1 → future cause step 2 → possible future event",
      "alternative future path step 1 → step 2 → another future event",
      "..."
    ],
    "confidence": 0.0
  }
]

If there is no clearly relevant Influence Event, the **THOUGHTS** section should explain this and the **JSON** section should be:
[]

Now analyze the following text chunk and produce **THOUGHTS** and **JSON** in exactly this order:
---
$chunk_text
