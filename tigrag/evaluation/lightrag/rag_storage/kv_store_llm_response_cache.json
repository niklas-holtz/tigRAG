Please find only the missing entities and relationships from previous text.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, use same language as input text. If English, capitalized the name\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event,category]\n- entity_description: Provide a comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities *based solely on the information present in the input text*. **Do not infer or hallucinate information not explicitly stated.** If the text provides insufficient information to create a comprehensive description, state \"Description not available in text.\"\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n- relationship_keywords: one or more high-level key words that summarize the overarching nature of the relationship, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_keywords><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Identify high-level key words that summarize the main concepts, themes, or topics of the entire text. These should capture the overarching ideas present in the document.\nFormat the content-level key words as (\"content_keywords\"<|><high_level_keywords>)\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n5. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n---Output---\n\nAdd new entities and relations below using the same format, and do not include entities and relations that have been previously extracted. :",

    "return": "# Deep Learning vs. Traditional Machine Learning\n\n## How Deep Learning Improves on Traditional Machine Learning\n\nDeep Learning (DL) is a specialized branch of Machine Learning that uses multi-layered artificial neural networks to model complex patterns in large datasets. It represents an advancement over traditional Machine Learning approaches in several key ways:\n\n1. **Superior Performance**: Deep Learning models often achieve state-of-the-art results in many AI benchmarks, demonstrating their effectiveness compared to traditional methods.\n\n2. **Automatic Feature Extraction**: While traditional ML often requires manual feature engineering, deep neural networks can automatically learn relevant features from raw data.\n\n3. **Specialized Applications**: Deep Learning has been particularly successful in complex areas such as:\n   - Image recognition\n   - Speech recognition\n   - Natural language understanding\n   - Autonomous driving\n\n## Main Drawbacks of Deep Learning\n\nDespite its advantages, Deep Learning comes with significant limitations:\n\n1. **Resource Requirements**: DL models require substantial computational resources to train and deploy effectively.\n\n2. **Data Dependency**: Deep Learning needs large volumes of labeled data to perform well, making it impractical for domains with limited data availability.\n\n3. **Complexity**: The multi-layered neural network architecture makes Deep Learning models more complex to design, train, and interpret compared to traditional Machine Learning approaches.\n\nDeep Learning represents a powerful subset of Machine Learning, which itself is a core subfield of the broader Artificial Intelligence discipline. While it excels in specific applications, the choice between Deep Learning and traditional Machine Learning methods should consider the specific requirements, constraints, and goals of each use case.\n\nReferences:\n1.
